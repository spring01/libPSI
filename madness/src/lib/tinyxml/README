This directory contains the *modified* source of TinyXML from
http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/ and
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml.  Its C++ source files, header
files, and readme.txt have been extracted, and "*.cpp" renamed to
"*.cc".  The TinyXML license information is contained in readme.txt.

The vanilla TinyXML tar file is contained in this directory along with
the tinyxml C++ source files (unmodified) and a MADNESS-specific
Makefile.

The only files in this directory that are part of MADNESS are
README and Makefile.

!! Message to MADNESS developers.  Please record below modifications
to any TinyXML file.


* RJH 2/2/2008.  Defined TIXML_USE_STL near top of tixml.h to
  force use of STL without modifying MADNESS configuration files.
