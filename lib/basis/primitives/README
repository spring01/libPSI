Brief Instructions:

Automation is really only for the Dunning basis sets. For others, use emsl_manipulate.pl directly.

[1]   Update any of the primitives (basis-, corevalence-, tight-, diffuse-, hold-, molpro-, etc.) 
      as needed. These come directly from EMSL.

[2]   Make the necessary hand edits to hold- files. Detailed instructions for first generation are 
      found in NOTES. Changes should only be necessary if their dependent basis sets from EMSL changed.

[3]   Run make_dunning.pl to generate the basis sets proper. dual adzp will be carried along but
      these need to be edited by hand to actually make changes.

[4]   Run dunning_prepend_and_checknew.pl to add spherical to the top of the file and show if the basis
      is any different from its current form (presently set to two directories up- change as needed).

[5]   Look at basisdunningdiffer.txt and transfer into the main basis directory any that have changed.

[6]   Delete basis sets here (keep primitives), tar back up and place in main basis directory.

[7]   Rerun documentbases.pl to regenerate the psi4bases.html file. Update the latter on the trac page.
