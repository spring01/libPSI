DETCI TO-DO LIST
===============================================================
Buffers bigger than 2E9 still don't work.  Known issues:
   o Calls to wreadw can't handle size > 2E9
   o vector.c contains lots of calls to be done on a per-buffer basis
     which allow only integer buffer sizes
   o need to finish converting to libpsio to avoid 2GB file pointer problem
     on Linux
