.SH NAME
nonbonded \- Compute non-bonded interactions empirically

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B nonbonded
computes various empirical terms for non-bonded interactions
(electrostatic and damped dispersion, presently).  It was initially
developed to test various Hartree-Fock + empirical dispersion models.
This is an experimental module and not meant for production use at
this time.  Gradients and second derivatives are available for empirical
dispersion terms only.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The following command-line arguments are available:
.IP "\fI-i fname\fP"
Gives the filename for the input file.  Defaults to input.dat.

.IP "\fI-o fname\fP"
Gives the filename for the output file.  Defaults to output.dat.

.LP
Additional input for this program is read from the file
.pN INPUT .
The following keywords are valid:

.IP "\fIPARTIAL_CHARGES\fP = \fIdouble_array\fP"
Partial charges on each atom, used for computation of empirical
electrostatics.  These contributions are included in the energy
but not yet in gradients.

.IP "\fIS6\fP = \fIdouble\fP"
Global scaling parameter for the damped dispersion terms.  The values
recommended by Grimme are 0.75 PBE, 1.2 BLYP, 1.05 B-P86, 1.0 TPSS,
1.05 B3LYP. Default is 1.0.

.IP "\fIDAMP\fP = \fIboolean\fP"
This boolean controls whether the dispersion terms are damped or not.
This should be set to true (the default) except for debugging.

.IP "\fID_DMP\fP = \fIdouble\fP"
Global damping exponent for damped dispersion terms.  The larger 
this factor, the faster the dispersion interaction will be damped out
as the interatomic distance decreases below the sum of the van der 
Waals radii.  With Grimme's damping factor, the damped dispersion term is
always 1/2 its undamped value when the atoms are at a distance equal to the
sum of the van der Waals radii.  For larger interatomic distances, the
larger D_DMP, the faster the damping term approaches 1 (leaving dispersion
undamped).

.IP "\fIVDW_RADII\fP = \fImixed array\fP"
The user can specify custom van der Walls radii for use in the dispersion
computation.  The array VDW_RADII contains a list of atomic symbols
and their associated van der Walls radii.  Example: vdw_radii = (Ne 0.95 Ar
1.50) will set the van der Walls radii of all neon atoms to 0.95 and all
argon atoms to 1.50.

.IP "\fIC6\fP = \fImixed array\fP"
The user can specify custom C6 coefficients for use in the dispersion
computation.  The array C6 contains a list of atomic symbols and their
associated C6 coefficients.  Example: C6 = (Ne 0.40 Ar 4.50) will set the
C6 coefficients of all neon atoms to 0.40 and all argon atoms to 4.50.
