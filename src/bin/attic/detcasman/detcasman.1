.SH NAME
detcasman \- Determinant Configuration Interaction / 
             Complete Active Space Self-Consistent-Field 
             Program Manager

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B detcasman
manages the orbital optimization in a complete-active-space
self-consistent field (CASSCF) procedure.  It is a very
simple program that runs the integral transformation, 
CI calculation, Lagrangian, and orbital rotation modules
that work with the DETCI program.  The real work of
orbital optimization is done in the program \fBdetcas\fP.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
.IP "\fBNCASITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of orbital optimization iterations to be carried out.  The
driver will stop when this many iterations have been completed, or earlier
if convergence has been achieved.  The default value is 30.  See the man 
pages for \fBDETCI\fP and \fBDETCAS\fP for setting the convergence criteria.
.IP "\fBSCALE_CONV =\fP \fIdouble\fP"
The scale factor to be used to determine the CI convergence from the 
previous iteration's orbital convergence.  We take the smaller of the
scaled and unscaled orbital gradients, and multiply this by the scale
factor to determine the CI vector convergence.  The default is 0.01.
