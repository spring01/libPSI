.SH NAME
detcas \- Determinant Configuration Interaction / Complete Active
          Space Self-Consistent-Field Program

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B detcas
performs a complete-active-space self-consistent-field
(CASSCF) optimization of molecular orbitals via a two-step
procedure in conjunction with the determinant configuration
interaction program DETCI.  The program is fairly simple
and currently uses a Newton-Raphson approach
to update the orbitals, employing a simple approximate
orbital Hessian.  Convergence is accelerated using
Pulay's direct inversion of the iterative
subspace (DIIS) procedure.  The code has been written to allow
more general wavefunctions that do not necessarily feature a
full CI treatment of the active space.  In particular, any
restricted active space (RAS) CI wavefunction supported by DETCI
can be used, allowing MCSCF wavefunctions of the RASSCF type.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The following command-line arguments are available:
.IP "\fI-quiet\fP"
This gives the same result as \fBPRINT=0\fP.

.IP "\fI-o fname\fP"
Gives the filename for the output file.  Defaults to output.dat.

.LP
Additional input for this program is read from the file input.dat.
The more commonly used keywords are:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The supported wave function types are CASSCF and RASSCF.

.IP "\fBCONVERGENCE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Convergence desired on the orbital gradient.  Convergence is achieved when the
RMS of the error in the orbital gradient is less than 10**(-n).  The default 
is 4 for energy calculations and 7 for gradients.  

.IP "\fBDOCC =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
This vector gives the number of doubly occupied orbitals in each irrep.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBSOCC =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
This vector gives the number of singly occupied orbitals in each irrep.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBENERGY_CONVERGENCE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Convergence desired on the total MCSCF energy.  The default is 7.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_DOCC =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which will literally be frozen (not updated
in the MCSCF).
The Cotton ordering of the irredicible representations is used.
The default is the zero vector. 

.IP "\fBFROZEN_UOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of highest energy unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which will literally be frozen (not updated
in the MCSCF).
The default is the zero vector.

.IP "\fBRESTRICTED_DOCC =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which will be optimized but kept doubly occupied
in the MCSCF.  These orbitals come after the \fBFROZEN_DOCC\fP orbitals.
The default is the zero vector. 

.IP "\fBRESTRICTED_UOCC =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
The number of highest energy unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which will be optimized but kept unoccupied
in the MCSCF.  These orbitals come before the \fBFROZEN_UOCC\fP orbitals.
The default is the zero vector. 

.IP "\fBNCASITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Maximum number of iterations to optimize the orbitals.  This option
\fBshould be specified in the DEFAULT section of input\fP, because
it needs to be visible to the control program PSI.  Defaults to 1.

.IP "\fBPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This option determines the verbosity of the output.  A value of 1 or
2 specifies minimal printing, a value of 3 specifies verbose printing.
Values of 4 or 5 are used for debugging.  Do not use level 5 unless
the test case is very small (e.g. STO H2O CISD).

.LP
The less commonly used keywords are:

.IP "\fBDIIS_FREQ =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The DIIS extrapolation procedure will be attempted every \fIn\fP
iterations.  The default is 1.

.IP "\fBDIIS_MAX_VECS =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum number of subspace vectors for the DIIS procedure.  After this 
number of vectors are reached, older vectors will be dropped from the
subspace as necessary.  The default is 8.

.IP "\fBDIIS_MIN_VECS =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The minimum number of subspace vectors before a DIIS interpolation can
be performed.  The default is 2.  It doesn't make sense to have values
less than 2.

.IP "\fBDIIS_START =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The iteration number when Pulay's Direct Inversion of the Iterative
Subspace (DIIS) procedure for acceleration of convergence should be
turned on.  The default is 3.  Prior to this iteration, vectors are 
not added to the DIIS subspace.  The first DIIS step will not be taken until 
\fBDIIS_MIN_VECS\fP vectors are in the DIIS subspace. 

.IP "\fBLAG_FILE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
File (unit number) for reading the lagrangian matrix.
The default value is currently 75.

.IP "\fBOPDM_FILE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
File (unit number) for reading the one-particle density matrix.
The default value is currently 73.

.IP "\fBSCALE_GRAD =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Tells whether to scale the orbital gradient by the approximate 
(diagonal) orbital Hessian.  The default is TRUE.

.IP "\fBSCALE_STEP =\fP \fIreal\fP"
Scale factor for the orbital rotation step.  Default is 1.0.

.IP "\fBTPDM_FILE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
File (unit number) for reading the two-particle density matrix.
The default value is currently 74.

.IP "\fBLEVEL_SHIFT =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Tells whether to allow for level shifting of the hessian matrix.  This can
be used to ensure that the hessian is positive definite for the beginning
iterations.  If the hessian is not positive definite near convergence, then
this may be a sign of numerical instabilities in the MCSCF.  The default
is TRUE.

.IP "\fBSHIFT =\fP \fIreal\fP"
Tells how much the diagonal elements of the hessian should be shifted for
level shifting.  Default is 0.01.

.IP "\fBDETERM_MIN =\fP \fIreal\fP"
Minimum allowed valued for the determinant of the hessian matrix if
level shifting is on.  This is not used if LEVEL_SHIFT=FALSE.  
Default is 0.00001.

.IP "\fBSTEP_MAX =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the maximum allowed single orbital rotation.  Default is 0.30.

.IP "\fBFORCE_STEP =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This allows the user to overide the calculated step and to force a step
in a particular direction.  This can be usefull if trying to force the 
calculation away from a saddle point.  The default is FALSE.

.IP "\fBFORCE_PAIR =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This is the index for the independent pair which is to be rotated if 
FORCE_STEP=TRUE.  This is ignored otherwise.  There is no default.  

.IP "\fBFORCE_VALUE =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the orbital rotation value for rotating the orbitals specified
by FORCE_PAIR.  This is only used if FORCE_STEP is set to TRUE.  The 
default value is 0.0.

.IP "\fBCHECK_HESSIAN =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Calculate the eigenvalues of the orbital hessian.  This is good for checking
for saddle-point solutions.  Should be used without level shifting.  The
default is FALSE.

.IP "\fBEIGEN_VECTORS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Do you want to calculate the eigenvectors of the orbital hessian as well.
This is ignored if CHECK_HESSIAN=FALSE.  Default is FALSE.
