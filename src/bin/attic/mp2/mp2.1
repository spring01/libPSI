.SH NAME
mp2 \- Moller-Plesset Perburbation Theory

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The module determines the second-order Moller-Plesset energy and 
one-particle density matrix (OPDM) for RHF, UHF, and ROHF (using 
semicanonical orbitals) references.  Frozen orbitals can be used 
when computing the energy but not the OPDM.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
Input for this program is read from the file input.dat. The following
keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the type of wave function desired. The only valid entry
at the present is \fIMP2\fP. There is no default.

.IP "\fBREFERENCE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the type of orbitals used for the single-determinant
reference function. Valid entries include RHF, UHF, and ROHF.  
There is no default.

.IP "\fBPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Determines the verbosity of the output.  A value of 0 (the default)
specifies minimal printing.

.IP "\fBCACHETYPE=\fP \fIstring\fP"
Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache
used by the DPD codes.  (See libdpd.html for further details.)  A
value of \fILOW\fP (the default) selects a "low priority"
scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on
pre-programmed priorities.  A value of \fILRU\fP selects a
"least recently used" scheme in which the oldest item in the cache
will be the first one deleted.

.IP "\fBCACHELEV=\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Selects the level of automatic cacheing desired in the storage of
various amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the coupled
cluster procedure.  A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while
a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache.  For
particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain
types of memory problems.  The default is 2, which means that all
four-index quantites with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g.,
<ij|ab> integrals) may be held in the cache.

.IP "\fBOPDM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If \fBTRUE\fP calculate the one-particle density matrix and 
make \fBOPDM_WRITE\fP default to \fBTRUE\fP.  The default value 
of \fBOPDM\fP is \fBFALSE\fP.

.IP "\fBOPDM_WRITE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Flag for whether or not to write the one-particle density matrix
to disk.

.IP "\fBOPDM_PRINT =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Flag for whether or not to print the one-particle density matrix.
