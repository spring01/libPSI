This is how to compile LIBDERIV:
1) This compilation requires some significant scratch space.  If the user
has defined the environmental variable SCRATCH, then the compilation
proceeds in $(SCRATCH)/libderiv.  Otherwise, the default location is
/tmp/$(USER)/libderiv.  You need to make sure this location has enough
disk space.

2) Edit input.dat and modify input parameters. The following parameters are
valid:
  NEW_AM - the desired maximum angular momentum times 2 (see an example
 below);

  *EXAMPLE*: if one wants LIBDERIV work for up to (ff|ff) integrals (the
 current PSI 2.0 limit), NEW_AM has to be set
 to 6 (f corresponds to l=3, (ff|ff) class will require at most the (k0|k0)
 class to be computed using Level 0 VRR routines). Note that to compile
 LIBDERIV with some NEW_AM=a one needs to have LIBINT with NEW_AM >=a+2
 already in place.

3) Type 'make' to begin compilation.  This might take awhile. Get a 
cup of tea, or go get some sun.

4) If you get any error messages - contact the author.
