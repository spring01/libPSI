Ok, a note to future generations:  You MUST BE VERY CAREFUL in taking
care of unusual cases.  Example: the current incarnation of yosh_read34()
has the possibility of writing out an iwl buffer that contains all
zeroes.  The read routines need to be able to handle such an eventuality.
Always think about such unusual possibilities when modifying this code...
what happens if the read stops at the exact last position in the buffer,
what if there are empty buffers, etc, etc.
Any mistake in this area will be nearly impossible to track down later.
