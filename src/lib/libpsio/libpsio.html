<h3><a name="philosophy">I. The structure and philosophy of the
library</a></h3>

Many I/O libraries for quantum chemistry packages (including those in
the old PSI2 code) expect the programmer to know the byte-by-byte
layout of the given binary file.  Accordingly, the primary read
and write functions in such libraries require as an argument a global
bytewise file pointer to the beginning of the desired data.  As a
result, when this pointer is defined to be an unsigned four-byte
integer (common on 32-bit computers), the total size of the direct
access file is limited to 4 GB (2<sup>32</sup> bytes).  Furthermore,
in order to avoid code duplication, this I/O design requires that one
construct specialized libraries of functions (e.g., <tt>libfile30</tt>
in PSI2) for interaction with particularly complicated files such as a
checkpoint file.  Even slight modification of the file layout can
require substantial changes to such libraries.<p>

This PSI3 I/O library, <tt>libpsio</tt>, is intended to overcome these
problems in two ways:
<ul>
  <li> Each file makes use of its own <b>table of contents (TOC)</b>
       which contains file-global starting and ending addresses for each
       data item.</li>
  <li> Addresses to data items in the TOC are provided to the standard
       read and write functions by the programmer as <b>entry-relative
       page/offset pairs</b>, which are translated to file-global
       addresses internally.</li>
</ul><p>

Data items in the TOC are identified by keyword strings (e.g.,
<tt>"Nuclear Repulsion Energy"</tt>).  If the programmer wishes to
read or write an entire TOC entry, he/she is required to provide only
the TOC keyword and the entry size (in bytes) to obtain the data; the
entry's global starting address is supplied by the TOC.  Furthermore,
it is possible to read pieces of TOC entries (say a single buffer of a
large list of two-electron integrals) by providing the appropriate TOC
keyword, a size, and a starting address relative to the beginning of
the TOC entry.  In short, the TOC design hides all information about
the <em>global</em> structure of the file from the programmer and
allows him/her to be concerned only with the structure of individual
entries.<p>

<h3><a name="file structure">II. The structure of <tt>libpsio</tt>
file</a></h3>

The first element in every <tt>libpsio</tt> file is a single
integer, <tt>toclen</tt>, indicating the number of entries in the
file.  Each entry is stored together with its TOC "header", i.e., the
keyword-string and global-address information for the data.  When the
file is opened, the first entry's TOC header is read from the file
into an in-core TOC list.  If a second entry exists, the
ending-address data from the first entry is used to <tt>lseek()</tt>
to the next entry, whose header is read into the in-core TOC, and so
on. If a new entry is added or an existing entry is modified (e.g.,
extended), both the in-core TOC and the corresponding TOC header
on-disk are updated automatically.  This prevents most cases of
corruption of the file in case of a program crash.

Apart from the <tt>toclen</tt> integer, the file itself is viewed by
the library as a series of pages, each of which contains an identical
number of bytes.  The global address of the beginning of a given entry
is stored on the TOC as a page/offset pair comprised of the starting
page and byte-offset on that page where the data reside.
The <em>entry-relative</em> page/offset addresses which the programmer
must provide work in exactly the same manner, but the 0/0 (PSIO_ZERO)
position is taken to be the beginning of the desired entry rather than
the beginning of the file.

<h3><a name="basic interface">II. The user interface</a></h3>

All of the functions needed to carry out basic I/O are described in
this subsection.  Proper declarations of these routines are provided
by the header file <tt><font color=purple>psio.h</font></tt>.  Note
that before any open/close functions may be called, the input parsing
library, <tt>libipv1</tt> must be initialized so that the necessary
file striping information may be read from user input.  (See the
PSI3 programmer's manual for details on the current version of the
input parser.) Also note that <tt>ULI</tt> is used as an abbreviation
for <tt>unsigned long int</tt> in the remainder of this manual.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_init(void)</font></b></tt>: Before any
files may be opened or the basic read/write functions of
<tt>libpsio</tt> may be used, the global data needed by the library
functions must be initialized using this function.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_ipv1_config(void)</font></b></tt>:
If the library is operator within a PSI module, the library can find
its configuration data in the input file or in the .psirc file when this
function is called. Therefore it should be called immediately after
<tt>psio_init()</tt>. <p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_done(void)</font></b></tt>: When
all interaction with the files is complete, this function is used to
free the library's global memory.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_open(ULI unit, int
status)</font></b></tt>: Opens the binary file identified by
<tt>unit</tt>.  The <tt>status</tt> flag is a boolean used to indicate
if the file is new (PSIO_OPEN_NEW) or if it already exists and is
being re-opened (PSIO_OPEN_OLD).  If specified in the user input file,
the file will be automatically opened as a multivolume (striped) file,
and each page of data will be read from or written to each volume in
succession.  (Note that a non-existent file can still be opened with
status PSIO_OPEN_OLD.)<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_close(ULI unit, int
keep)</font></b></tt>: Closes a binary file identified by
<tt>unit</tt>.  The <tt>keep</tt> flag is a boolean used to indicate
if the file's volumes should be deleted (0) or retained (1) after
being closed.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_read_entry(ULI unit, char *key, char
*buffer, ULI size)</font></b></tt>: Used to read an entire TOC entry
identified by the string <tt>key</tt> from <tt>unit</tt> into the
array <tt>buffer</tt>.  The number of bytes to be read is given by
<tt>size</tt>, but this value is only used to ensure that the read
request does not exceed the end of the entry.  If the entry does not
exist, an error is printed to <tt>stderr</tt> and the program will
exit.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_write_entry(ULI unit, char *key, char
*buffer, ULI size)</font></b></tt>: Used to write an entire TOC entry
idenitified by the string <tt>key</tt> to <tt>unit</tt> into the array
<tt>buffer</tt>.  The number of bytes to be written is given by
<tt>size</tt>.  If the entry already exists and its data is being
overwritten, the value of <tt>size</tt> is used to ensure that the
write request does not exceed the end of the entry.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_read(ULI unit, char *key, char
*buffer, ULI size, psio_address sadd, psio_address
*eadd)</font></b></tt>: Used to read a fragment of <tt>size</tt> bytes
of a given TOC entry identified by <tt>key</tt> from <tt>unit</tt>
into the array <tt>buffer</tt>.  The starting address is given by the
<tt>sadd</tt> and the ending address (that is, the entry-relative
address of the next byte in the file) is returned in
<tt>*eadd</tt>.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_write(ULI unit, char *key, char
*buffer, ULI size, psio_address sadd, psio_address
*eadd)</font></b></tt>: Used to write a fragment of <tt>size</tt>
bytes of a given TOC entry identified by <tt>key</tt> to <tt>unit</tt>
into the array <tt>buffer</tt>.  The starting address is given by the
<tt>sadd</tt> and the ending address (that is, the entry-relative
address of the next byte in the file) is returned in
<tt>*eadd</tt>.<p>

The page/offset address pairs required by the preceeding read and
write functions are supplied via variables of the data type
<tt>psio_address</tt>, defined by:<p>

<tt><b><font color=green>
typedef struct {<br>
  ULI page;<br>
  ULI offset;<br>
} psio_address;<br>
</font></b></tt><br>

The <tt>PSIO_ZERO</tt> defined as a global variable provides a
convenient input for the 0/0 page/offset.<p>

<h3><a name="TOC manipulation">III. Manipulating the table of contents</a></h3>

In addition, to the basic open/close/read/write functions
described above, the programmer also has a limited ability to directly
manipulate or examine the data in the TOC itself.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_tocprint(ULI unit, FILE
*outfile)</font></b></tt>: Prints the TOC of <tt>unit</tt> in a
readable form to <tt>outfile</tt>, including entry keywords and
starting/ending addresses.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_toclen(ULI unit, FILE
*outfile)</font></b></tt>:  Returns the number of entries in the TOC
of <tt>unit</tt>.<p>

<tt><b><font color=darkblue>int psio_tocdel(ULI unit, char
*key)</font></b></tt>: Deletes the TOC entry corresponding to
<tt>key</tt>.  NB: Do not use this function if you are not a PSI3
expert. This function only deletes the entry's reference from the TOC
itself and does not remove the corresponding data from the file.
Hence, it is possible to introduce data "holes" into the file.<p>

<h3><a name="examples">IV. Some simple examples</a></h3>

The following code illustrates the basic use of the library, as well
as when/how the <tt>psio_init()</tt> and <tt>psio_done()</tt> functions
should be called in relation to initialization of <tt>libipv1</tt>.
