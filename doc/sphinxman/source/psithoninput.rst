Psithon: Structuring an Input File
==================================

To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, |PSIfour| was built
upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some
pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,
resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon.  In
this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.
|PSIfour| is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section
:ref:`apdx:testSuite`; the input files for these test cases can be found in the
samples subdirectory of the top-level |PSIfour| source directory, and should
serve as useful examples.

.. index:: physical constants
.. _`sec:physicalConstants`:

Physical Constants
==================

For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the
|psirc| file in the current user's home area (if present) before performing any
tasks in the input file.  This allows frequently used python variables to be
automatically defined in all input files.  For example, if we repeatedly make
use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed
in the |psirc| file ::

    UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2

which would make the variable ``UGC`` available in all |PSIfour| input files.
For convenience, the physical constants used within the |PSIfour| code (which
are obtained from the 3rd edition of the IUPAC Green
book [Cohen:GreenBook:2008]_) are also automatically loaded as Psithon
variables (before |psirc| is loaded, so that |psirc| values can be overridden by
the user).

made available within all |PSIfour| input files.

The ``psi_`` prefix is to prevent clashes with user-defined variables in
|PSIfour| input files.

.. index:: molecule; specification
.. _`sec:moleculeSpecification`:

Molecule and Geometry Specification
===================================

|PSIfour| has a very flexible input parser that allows the user to provide
geometries as Cartesian coordinates, Z-matrix variables, or a combination of
both. The use of fixed values and variables are supported for both. For
example, the geometry for H\ :sub:`2` can be specified a number of ways, using the
``molecule`` keyword::

    molecule{
      H
      H 1 0.9
    }
    
     or
    
    molecule{
      H
      H 1 r
      r = 0.9
    }
    
     or
    
    molecule{
      H1
      H2 H1 0.9
    }
    
     or
    
    molecule{
      H 0.0 0.0 0.0
      H 0.0 0.0 0.9
    }
    
     or
    
    molecule{
      H 0.0 0.0 0.0
      H 0.0 0.0 r
      r = 0.9
    }
    
     or
    
    molecule{
      H 0.0 0.0 -r
      H 0.0 0.0 r
      r = 0.45
    }

Blank lines are ignored and, unlike regular Python syntax, indentation within
the ``molecule`` block does not matter, although the ``molecule`` keyword itself must
be aligned within the input according to standard Python syntax. For more
examples of geometry specification, see the :srcsample:`mints1` input file in the samples
folder. It is also possible to mix Cartesian and Z-matrix geometry
specifications, as demonstrated in the :srcsample:`mints4` and
:srcsample:`mints6` sample input files.  For example, consider the following
geometry specification, taken from the :srcsample:`mints6` input::

    molecule alanine {

        dHCCC2 = 120.0
        dHCCC3 = 240.0
    }

Here, we remove the hydrogen from the alpha carbon of glycine and replace it
with a methyl group.  Applying this patch using Cartesian coordinates is
difficult, because it depends on the orientation of the existing glycine unit.
In this example, we use Z-Matrix coordinates to define the methyl group, and
define the orientation in terms of the existing glycine Cartesian coordinates
which is much easier to visualize than the corresponding Cartesian-only
approach.

.. _`sec:multipleMolecules`:

Multiple Molecules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for
each molecule, and tell |PSIfour| which one should be used in a given
calculation. For example, consider the following input file::

    molecule h2{
      H
      H 1 0.9
    }
    
    
    set basis cc-pvdz
    set reference rhf
    energy('scf')
    
    molecule h{
      H
    }
    
    set basis cc-pvdz
    set reference uhf
    energy('scf')

Here, two separate jobs are performed on two different molecules; the first is
performed on H\ :sub:`2`, while the second is for H atom. The last molecule to be
specified is the "active" molecule by default. To explicitly activate a named
molecule, the activate keyword is provided. Using this keyword, the above input
file can be equivalently written as follows::

    molecule h2{
      H
      H 1 0.9
    }
    
    molecule h{
      H
    }
    
    activate(h2)
    set basis cc-pvdz
    set reference rhf
    energy('scf')
    
    activate(h)
    set basis cc-pvdz
    set reference uhf
    energy('scf')

Note that whenever the molecule is changed, the basis set must be specified
again. The following section provides more details about the job control
keywords used in the above examples.

.. _`sec:moleculeKeywords`:

Molecule Keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to specifying the geometry, additional information can be
provided in the :samp:`molecule {optional_molecule_name} \\{...\\}` block.
If two integers :samp:`{charge} {multiplicity}` are encountered on any
line of the molecule block, they are interpreted as the molecular charge
and multiplicity (:math:`2 \times M_s + 1`), respectively.  The symmetry
can be specified by a line reading :samp:`symmetry {symbol}`, where
:samp:`{symbol}` is the :ref:`Sch√∂nflies symbol <sec:symmetry>` of the
(Abelian) point group to use for the computation.  This need not be
specified, as the molecular symmetry is automatically detected by
|PSIfour|.  Certain computations require that the molecule is not
reoriented; this can be achieved by adding either ``no_reorient`` or
``noreorient``. By default, |Angstrom| units are used; this is changed by
adding a line that reads :samp:`units {spec}`, where :samp:`{spec}` is one
of ``ang``, ``angstrom``, ``a.u.``, ``au``, or ``bohr``.

.. _`sec:ghosts`:

Ghost Atoms
^^^^^^^^^^^

While many common computations, such as SAPT and counterpoise corrections, can
be greatly simplified using the notation described in :ref:`sec:fragments`,
manual specification of ghost atoms is sometimes required.  Either ::

    molecule he2 {
        He
        Gh(He) 1 2.0
    }

or ::

    molecule he2 {
        He
        @He 1 2.0
    }

will generate a helium dimer, with the second atom ghosted, *i.e.*, possessing
basis functions but no electrons or nuclear charge.  See :srcsample:`dfmp2_1`
and :srcsample:`ghosts` for a demonstration of both mechanisms for specifying
ghost atoms.

Geometries from the `PubChem <http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ Database
==========================================================================

Obtaining rough starting guess geometries can be burdensome.  The Z-matrix
coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for
guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles.  While Z-matrix input is
intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes
laborious as the system size grows.  To obtain a reasonable starting guess
geometry, |PSIfour| can take a chemical name as input; this is then used
to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem]_ database.

For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification::

    molecule benzene {
        pubchem:benzene
    }

If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct
|PSIfour| to search PubChem for a starting structure.  The search is actually
performed for compounds whose name *contains* "benzene", so multiple
entries will be returned.  If the name provided ("benzene" in the above
example) exactly matches one of the results, that entry will be used.  If no
exact match is found the results, along with a unique chemical identifier
(CID), are printed to the output file, prompting the user to provide a more
specific name.  For example, if we know that we want to run a computation on a
compound whose name(s) contain "benzene", but we're not sure of the exact IUPAC
name, the following input can be used::

    molecule benzene {
        pubchem:benzene*
    }

Appending the "*" prevents an exact match from being found and, at the time
of writing, the following results are displayed in the output file::

     Chemical ID     IUPAC Name
              241   benzene
             7371   benzenesulfonic acid
            91526   benzenesulfonate
              244   phenylmethanol
              727   1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane
              240   benzaldehyde
            65723   benzenesulfonohydrazide
            74296   N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide
              289   benzene-1,2-diol
              243   benzoic acid

           636822   1,2,4-trimethoxy-5-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene
             7369   benzenesulfonyl chloride
            12932   N-[2-di(propan-2-yloxy)phosphinothioylsulfanylethyl]benzenesulfonamide

            78438   N-[anilino(phenyl)phosphoryl]aniline
            12581   3-phenylpropanenitrile
           517327   sodium benzenesulfonate
           637563   1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene
           252325   [(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene

Note that some of these results do not contain the string "benzene"; these
compounds have synonyms containing that text.  We can now replace the
"benzene*" in the input file with one of the above compounds using either the
IUPAC name or the CID provided in the list, *viz*::

    molecule benzene {
        pubchem:637563
    }
    
     or
    
    molecule benzene {
        pubchem:1-methoxy-4-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]benzene
    }

Some of the structures in the database are quite loosely optimized and do not
have the correct symmetry.  Before starting the computation, |PSIfour| will
check to see if the molecule is close to having each of the possible
symmetries, and will adjust the structure accordingly so that the maximum
symmetry is utilized.

The standard keywords, described in Sec. :ref:`sec:moleculeKeywords`, can be
used in conjuction to specify charge, multiplicity, symmetry to use, *etc.* .

.. index:: symmetry, Cotton-ordering
.. _`sec:symmetry`:

Symmetry
========

For efficiency, |PSIfour| can utilize the largest Abelian subgroup of the full
point group of the molecule.  Concomitantly a number of quantities, such as
|globals__socc| and |globals__docc|, are arrays whose entries pertain to irreducible
representations (irreps) of the molecular point group.  Ordering of irreps
follows the convention used in Cotton's :title:`Chemical Applications of Group
Theory`, as detailed in Table :ref:`Irreps <table:irrepOrdering>`.  We refer to this
convention as "Cotton Ordering" hereafter.

For example, water (:math:`C_{2v}` symmetry) has 3 doubly occupied :math:`A_1`
orbitals, as well as 1 each of :math:`B_1` and :math:`B_2` symmetry; the
corresponding |globals__docc| array is therefore::

    DOCC = [3, 0, 1, 1]

Although |PSIfour| will detect the symmetry automatically, and use the largest
possible Abelian subgroup, the user might want to run in a lower point group.
To do this the ``symmetry`` keyword can be used when inputting the molecule
(see Sec. :ref:`sec:moleculeSpecification`).  In most cases the standard
Sch√∂nflies symbol (one of ``c1``, ``c2``, ``ci``, ``cs``, ``d2``,
``c2h``, ``c2v``, ``d2h`` will suffice.
For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular
subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier.  For example when
running a computation on a molecule with :math:`D_{2h}` symmetry in :math:`C_{2v}`, the
:math:`C_2` axis can be chosen as either the :math:`x`, the :math:`y`, or the :math:`z`; these can
be specified by requesing the symmetry as ``c2vx``, ``c2vy``, or ``c2vz``, respectively.
Likewise the ``c2x``, ``c2y``, ``c2z``, ``c2hx``, ``c2hy``, and ``c2hz``
labels are valid.  For :math:`C_s` symmetry the labels ``csx``, ``csy``, and
``csz`` request the :math:`yz`, :math:`xz`, and :math:`xy` planes be used as the mirror plane,
respectively.  If no unique axis is specified, |PSIfour| will choose an appropriate
subgroup.

Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational
frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule.  When this happens
symmetry-dependent arrays, such as |globals__socc|, are automatically remapped
to the lower symmetry.  For example, if we were to investigate the :math:`^2B_1`
state of water cation, we can specify

    SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]

in the input file.  If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above
array will be appropriately remapped.  For example, reducing the symmetry to
:math:`C_s` (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above
array will be automatically interpreted as:

    SOCC = [0, 1]

Some caution is required, however.  The :math:`^2A_1` state can be obtained with
the

    SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]

specification, which would become

    SOCC = [1, 0]

under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry.  The :math:`^2B_2` state,
whose singly-occupied orbitals are

    SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]

would be mapped to 

    SOCC = [1, 0]

which is the same occupation as the :math:`^2A_1` state.  In this case, the
:math:`^2A_1` state is lower in energy, and is not problematic.  The distorted
geometries for the :math:`^2B_2` state are excited states that are subject to
variational collapse.  One way to obtain reliable energies for these states is
to use a multi-state method; in this case it's easier to run the entire
computation in the lowest symmetry needed during the finite difference
procedure.

.. index:: molecule; multiple fragments
.. _`sec:fragments`:

Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments
========================================

|PSIfour| has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent
intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted
perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments
are interacting within the complex. |PSIfour| provides a very simple mechanism
for doing so; simply define the complex's geometry using the standard
Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two
dashes between nonbonded fragements. For example, to study the interaction
energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we can use the following molecule
block::

    molecule eneyne {
      0 1
      C  0.000000 -0.667578  -2.124659
      C  0.000000  0.667578  -2.124659
      H  0.923621 -1.232253  -2.126185
      H -0.923621 -1.232253  -2.126185
      H -0.923621  1.232253  -2.126185
      H  0.923621  1.232253  -2.126185
      --
      0 1
      C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503
      C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240
      H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352
      H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929
    }

In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is
explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the
first fragment, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When
considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all
fragment charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to
yield the highest possible :math:`M_s` value.

Having defined a molecule containing fragments like ``eneyne`` above, it
is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the
fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene
fragment alone (``extract_subsets(1)`` pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms
and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the
ethyne fragment ghosted (``extract_subsets(1,2)`` pulls out fragment 1 as
Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular
complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. ``extract_subsets(2,[1,3])``::

   mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1)
   energy('scf')
   
   clean()
   
   mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2)
   energy('scf')

Job Control
===========

|PSIfour| comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform
specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module
recognizes specific keywords in the input file, detailed in Appendix :ref:`apdx:options_c_module`, which
control its function. The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to
certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways
that global keywords can be specified::

    # all equivalent

    set globals basis cc-pVDZ

    set basis cc-pVDZ

    set globals basis = cc-pVDZ

    set basis = cc-pVDZ

    set globals{
      basis cc-pVDZ
    }
    
    set {
      basis cc-pVDZ
    }
    
    set {
      basis = cc-pVDZ
    }

Note the lack of quotes around ``cc-pVDZ``, even though it is a string. The
Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in ``set`` commands in
strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying
multiple keywords::

    set {
      basis = cc-pVDZ
      print = 1
      reference = rhf
    }

For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should
be used, *viz.*::

    set {
      docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]
    }

List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening ``[`` is
on the same line as the name of the keyword.

Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,
by adding the name of the module after the ``set`` keyword. Omitting the module
name, or using the name ``global`` or ``globals`` will result in the keyword being
applied to all modules. For example, in the following input ::

    molecule{
      o
      h 1 roh
      h 1 roh 2 ahoh
    
      roh = 0.957
      ahoh = 104.5
    }
    
    set basis cc-pVDZ
    set ccenergy print 3
    set scf print 1
    energy('ccsd')

the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print
level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs coupled cluster computations,
will use a print level of 3. In this example a full CCSD computation is
performed by running the SCF code first, then the coupled cluster modules;
the ``energy()`` Python helper function ensures that this is performed correctly.
Note that the Python interpreter executes commands in the order they appear in
the input file, so if the last four commands in the above example were to read ::

    set basis cc-pVDZ
    energy('ccsd')
    set ccenergy print 3
    set scf print 1

the commands that set the print level would be ineffective, as they would be
processed after the CCSD computation completes.

Assigning Basis Sets
====================

While the above syntax will suffice for specifying basis sets in most cases,
the user may need to assign basis sets to specific atoms.  To achieve this, a
``basis`` block can be used.  We use a snippet from the :srcsample:`mints2` sample
input file, which performs a benzene SCF computation, to demonstrate this
feature. ::

    basis {
       assign DZ
       assign C 3-21G
       assign H1 sto-3g
       assign C1 sto-3g
    }

The first line in this block assigns the DZ basis set to all atoms.  The next
line then assigns 3-21G to all carbon atoms, leaving the hydrogens with the DZ
basis set.  On the third line, the hydrogen atoms which have been specifically
labelled as ``H1`` are given the STO-3G basis set, leaving the unlabelled hydrogen
atoms with the DZ basis set.  Likewise, the fourth line assigns the STO-3G
basis set to just the carbon atoms labelled ``C1``.  This bizzare example was
constructed to demonstrate the syntax, but the flexibility of the basis set
specification is advantageous, for example, when selectivily omitting diffuse
functions to make computations more tractable.

.. index:: basis set; auxiliary

In the above example the basis sets have been assigned asymmetrically, reducing
the effective symmetry from :math:`D_{6h}` to :math:`C_{2v}`; |PSIfour| will detect this
automatically and run in the appropriate point group.  The same syntax can be
used to specify basis sets other than that used to define orbitals.  For
example, ::

    set df_basis_mp2 cc-pvdz-ri
    
     or
    
    basis {
       assign cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2
    }

are both equivalent ways to set the auxiliary basis set for density fitted MP2
computations.  To assign the aug-cc-pVDZ-RI to carbon atoms, the following
command is used::

    basis {
       assign C aug-cc-pVDZ-RI df_basis_mp2
    }

When most popular basis sets are being used, including Dunning and
Pople-style, the SCF, DF-MP2, and SAPT codes will chose the appropriate
auxiliary basis set automatically according to :ref:`apdx:basisFamily`,
unless instructed otherwise by setting the auxiliary basis set in the
input.  Finally, we note that the ``basis {...}`` block may also be used
for defining basis sets, as detailed in Sec. :ref:`sec:basisUserDefined`.

.. index:: memory
.. _`sec:memory`:

Memory Specification
====================

By default, |PSIfour| assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is
enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if
more is available. To specify memory, the ``memory`` keyword should be used. The following
lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available
to |PSIfour|::

    # all equivalent

    memory 2 Gb
    
    memory 2000 Mb
    
    memory 2000000 Kb

One convenient way to override the |PSIfour| default memory is to place a
memory command in the |psirc| file (Sec. :ref:`sec:psirc`). For example,
the following makes the default memory 2 Gb. ::

    set_memory(2000000000)

However, unless you're assured of having only one job running on a node at
a time (and all nodes on the filesystem with |psirc| have similar memory
capacities), it is advised to set memory in the input file on a
per-calculation basis.

.. note:: For parallel jobs, the ``memory`` keyword represents the total memory
   available to the job, *not* the memory per thread.

.. _`sec:psiVariables`:

Return Values and PSI Variables
===============================

To harness the power of Python, |PSIfour| makes the most pertinent results of
each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for
post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H\ :sub:`2`
and H atom::

    molecule h2{
      H
      H 1 0.9
    }
    
    set basis cc-pvdz
    set reference rhf
    h2_energy = energy('scf')
    
    molecule h{
      H
    }
    
    set basis cc-pvdz
    set reference uhf
    h_energy = energy('scf')
    
    D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol*(2*h_energy - h2_energy)
    print"De=%f"%D_e

The :py:func:`~driver.energy` function returns the final result of the
computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a
Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation
energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation.

Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix
:ref:`apdx:psivariables_module` lists PSI variables variables set by each
module.  These can be accessed through the ``get_variable()`` function.
For example, after performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the
spin component scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made
available::

    e_mp2=get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY')
    e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY')

Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a
calculation.  The values for all can be printed in the output file with
the input file command ``print_variables()``. Note that PSI variables
accumulate over a |PSIfour| instance and are not cleared by ``clean()``.
So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a
aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a ``print_variables()`` command, the last will
include both :psivar:`SCF TOTAL ENERGY <SCFTOTALENERGY>` and :psivar:`FCI
TOTAL ENERGY <FCITOTALENERGY>`. Don't get excited that you got a
high-quality calculation cheaply.

.. _`sec:loops`:

Loops
=====

Python provides many control structures, which can be used within |PSIfour|
input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can
be used::

    basis_sets=["cc-pVDZ","cc-pVTZ","cc-pVQZ"]
    for basis_set in basis_sets:
        set basis = $basis_set
        energy('scf')

The declaration of ``basis_set`` is completely standard Python, as is the next
line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor
wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that ``basis_set`` is a
Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. 

The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,
which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the
angle and bond length in water::

    molecule h2o{
      O
      H1 R
      H1 R2 A
    }
    
    Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]
    Avals=range(102,106,2)
    
    set basis cc-pvdz
    set scf e_convergence=11
    for R in Rvals:
        h2o.R = R
        for A in Avals:
            h2o.A = A
            energy('scf')

The declarations of ``Rvals`` and ``Avals`` are both completely standard Python syntax.
Having named our molecule ``h2o`` we can then set the values of ``R`` and ``A`` within
the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python
variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables
with the ``set`` keyword.

.. _`sec:resultsTables`:

Tables of Results
=================

The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the :py:func:`~text.Table` Psithon
function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water ::

    molecule h2o {
      O
      H 1 R
      H 1 R 2 A
    }
    
    Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]
    Avals=range(100,102,2)
    
    table=Table(rows=["R","A"], cols=["E(SCF)","E(SCS)","E(DFMP2)"])
    
    set basis cc-pvdz
    
    for R in Rvals:
        h2o.R = R
        for A in Avals:
            h2o.A = A
            energy('df-mp2')
            escf = get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY')
            edfmp2 = get_variable('DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY')
            escsmp2 = get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY')
            table[R][A] = [escf, escsmp2, edfmp2]
    
    print table
    relative=table.copy()
    relative.absolute_to_relative()
    print relative

we first define a table (on line 10) with two row indices and three column
indices. As the potential energy scan is performed, the results are stored
(line 22) and the final table is printed to the output file (line 24). The
table is converted from absolute energies to relative energies (in |kcalpermol|)
on line 26, before being printed again. The relative energies are reported with
respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the
formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see
Appendix :ref:`apdx:testSuite` for a complete listing.

.. _`sec:wrappers`:

Python Wrappers
===============

The Python foundations of the |PSIfour| driver and Psithon syntax permit
many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into
the |PSIfour| suite.
Among these are automated computations of interaction energies through
:py:func:`~wrappers.cp`, of a model chemistry applied to a database of systems through
:py:func:`~wrappers.database`, and of several model chemistries together approximating greater
accuracy through :py:func:`~wrappers.complete_basis_set`. 
These are discussed separately in section :ref:`sec:psithonFunc`.
Note that the options documented for Python functions are placed as arguments
in the command that calls the function, 
not in the ``set globals`` block or with any other ``set`` command.
