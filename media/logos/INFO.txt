[LAB 4-20-2012]

* Text "PSI4" is Optima Regular at 66 pt in CMYK = [100, 95, 0, 0]

* Text "Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry" is Optima Bold at 16 pt 
  in CMYK = [0, 0, 0, 100] with 100 (AI units) spacing stretch

* The difference between "vector" and other files in this directory is in
  the trimming of self-interference at the tips of the psi graphic. This
  process turns the psi into a raster object, so the color and 3D effects
  are no longer editable.

* All transparencies are set such that these can be placed over any color
  background.
